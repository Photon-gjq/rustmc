/// This file is a naive implementation of DQMC.
/// It can be expected that the error is *huge* with poor performance.
/// Nonetheless, it provides a benchmark for optimized and more efficient algorithms.
/// For example, we can do a few sweeps and check whether the optimized algorithms agree with the result of this naive implementation.
